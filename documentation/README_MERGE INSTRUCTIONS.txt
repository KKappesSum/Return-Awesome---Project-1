We have been doing our merges incorrectly. 

Don't try to merge remote branches in gitKraken. We tested extensively and it doesn't work too well.

Submitting code to GitHub
 - Checkout your local branch, push that branch to Github.
 - Go to Github and do a pull request (select compare master and your branch)
 - check the pull request: 
 - if we don't need to discuss changes, and if there are no conflicts shown, then merge the branches on Github.
 - then pull master so you have the most recent version of master locally.

 If you recieve a pull request:
 - Go to gitKraken and do a pull on your master branch
 - merge your local master with your local name branch (either on command line or in gitKraken)
 - resolve any merge conflicts from updated master and your named branch
 - now your local master and named branch should be at the same commit, continue working until ready to submit code
