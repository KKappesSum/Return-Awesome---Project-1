// WIP WIP WIP

We have been doing our merges incorrectly. 


 - Checkout your local branch, push that branch to Github.
 - Go to Github and do a pull request (select compare master and your branch)
 - check the pull request: 
 - if we don't need to discuss changes, and if there are no conflicts shown, then merge the branches on Github.
 - then pull master so you have the most recent version of master locally.
